# Dangl.WebDocumentation - Readme
[![Build Status](https://jenkins.dangl.me/buildStatus/icon?job=WebDocu.Tests)](https://jenkins.dangl.me/job/WebDocu.Tests/)


This is a small web application that I use to host generated project documentation in Html format. It allows to control access to whom can access a project, either by making projects publicly available or by enabling access to projects for specific users.  
It does accept a zip file as input and will then make the content available to be browsable through the web. You can use, for example, [Sharpdox](https://github.com/Geaz/sharpDox) to create html documentation for C# projects, zip the output and upload it as project.

Tests and code coverage reports are generated by running `TestaAndCoverage.ps1` in the root directory.

## Setup

Configuration expects a connection string in the appsettings at `Data:DefaultConnection:ConnectionString` and two variables, `AllowUserRegistration` and `SiteTitle`. Upon deployment, the first user to register is granted the admin role. For other users, admin roles are assigned manually by an existing admin.

## Configuration

Admins create and manage projects, set which users can access them and upload packages via the web interface. 

## Upload a package

Projects are expected in zip format. The zip archives content is copied on the server under the App_Data folder. Projects have a property defining which relative path to use initially, e.g. `index.html`.

### Via the web interface
Admins can simply select Upload Package in the admin section for a project and upload a zip file.

### Via the API
In the project edit section, the API key for a project is set, it is used for http uploads.
Example with cURL:  
`curl -F "ApiKey=<YourApiKey>" -F "Version=<DocVersion>" -F "ProjectPackage=@\"<PathToZipPackage>\"" https://<YourDomain>/API/Projects/Upload`

## Access a package

Project names are required to be unique for pretty urls. Access is routed via `https://<YourDomain>/Projects/<ProjectName>/<Version>/<PathToIndex>`

The `<Version>` parameter may be set to `latest` to display the most recent version of the package.

## Conventions When Accessing Documentation

Project file urls have the following format:

    https://<YourDomain>/Projects/<ProjectName>/<Version>/<PathToFile>

  * If `PathToFile` is missing, a redirect is returned pointing to the entry point, e.g.
    `https://docs.dangl-it.com/Projects/LightQuery/1.1.0` redirects to `https://docs.dangl-it.com/Projects/LightQuery/1.1.0/index.html`
  * If the `Version` is not found but a higher version is present, it redirects to the newer version. This is useful when you want to delete documentations
    for prerelease version. For example, `1.0.0-beta1` is requested but not present, if `1.0.0` is present, it gets redirected to it. This keeps old urls
    from becoming unavailable
  * If `PathToFile` is pointing to a non-existing file, a redirect to the entry point is returned

## Response Caching

Responses for project files have two different `Cache-Control` headers:
* `3600` (1 hour) if the version accessed is `latest`
* `604800` (7 days) if any other version is accessed
